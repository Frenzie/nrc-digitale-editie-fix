NRC Digitale Editie Fix
=======================

Suppresses the default annoying behavior of digital NRC. Instead of opening articles in a lightbox only accessible through left click, this script replaces this ludicrousness with regular links so you get all the power that comes with regular links, such as opening them in background, creating linked windows, et cetera.

This script can be used alone, but I recommend using it in conjunction with my new user CSS, which remains closer to the default layout),or [Zotlan's](http://extendopera.org/css/content/nrc-digital-edition-white-black), which turns the contrast around.

A separate settings file can be used, though for now there's only one setting. Therefore the example settings file comes with that setting switched from the default.
