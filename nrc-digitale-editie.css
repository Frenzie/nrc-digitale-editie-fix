/*
nrc-digitale-editie.css
This stylesheet tries to make the new NRC website a little more usable and fluid.
It also makes the links to the different sections on the left a little smaller so more (or all) can fit on the screen at once.
I recommend using it in combination with a stylesheet that has light text on a dark background.
The default black on white is kind of horrible.

Changelog
1.01 2011-01-30 Some refinements.
1.0 2011-01-29 First release.

For some unknown reason this one's 575px wide in the default layout even though what's within is only 400px.
Bravo, lots of wasted space on the right. Can't be bothered to make it more fluid atm.

Why so much specificity!? Trying to make adjustments like this stylesheet harder or something? <_<
But most of all this just makes processing the CSS take longer. Thanks for slowing my browser down.
This adjustment makes all of the newspaper sections fit on my screen without having to scroll down.

Just because it's a newspaper website doesn't mean I want uber-narrow columns; I don't want stupid paper limitations on my screen.
A stupid faux Javascript link for printing is the *opposite* of an acceptable reason for shrinking my content.
